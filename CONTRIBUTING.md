# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, but to keep things organized, keep in mind the following rules.

# Bug Reports

When reporting a bug in the Laravel Auditing Filesystem driver package, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kyagie/laravel-auditing-filesystem/issues) of the main repository.

# Pull Requests

Fixing a bug, correcting a typo or adding a new feature?

Just remember that all pull requests should be done against the `main` branch.
